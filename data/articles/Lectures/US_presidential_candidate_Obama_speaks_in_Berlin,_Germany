The speech was received very well in Germany and back in the United States. The German newspaper ''[[W:Bild|Bild]]'' stated that "unlike George W. Bush, [Obama] wants to do this in cooperation with others, especially Europe."

The ''[[W:National Review|National Review]]'''s Jim Geraghty commended Obama on pushing Germany for more help in Afghanistan: "If Barack Obama can convince the Germans to contribute more to the mission in Afghanistan, God bless him, I mean that." Germany's own ''[[W:Der Tagesspiegel|Der Tagesspiegel]]'' commented that the speech "was the signal of a new era for a new generation on both sides of the Atlantic."

The [[John McCain|McCain]] campaign said that the speech was "eloquent praise for this country." However McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds also said that "while Barack Obama took a premature victory lap today in the heart of Berlin, proclaiming himself a 'citizen of the world,' John McCain continued to make his case to the American citizens who will decide this election."

Barack Obama arrived in Berlin on July 24. His stop in Berlin was part of his [[Middle East]]/[[Europe]]an tour that he has conducted to shore up his foreign relations record. Friday, Obama continued on to [[Paris]], [[France]].
