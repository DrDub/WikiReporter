This weekend saw the opening of two new exhibitions at [[Edinburgh]]'s {{w|Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art|National Gallery of Modern Art}}. ''Wikinews'' attended Thursday's press preview for the event where a full contingent of the capital's press turned out to see the striking collection of paintings, photographs, and other works. Presented below are a selection of images captured at the preview.

''REFLECTIONS: A Series of Changing Displays of Contemporary Art'', billed as a showcase of a "diverse range of internationally-renowned contemporary and modern artists" is to display major works from the Gallery's permanent collection, alongside important loans. Alongside this broad range of works, a three-room display of pieces on-loan from the {{w|Roy Lichtenstein}} Foundation &mdash; with a dramatic painted steel relief, 'borrowed' from the {{w|Tate Britain|Tate}} in [[London]] &mdash; runs from March 14 through to January 10 next year.

Admission to both exhibitions is free; being located in {{w|Dean Village|Dean}}, to the north-west of Edinburgh's city centre, a free Gallery bus service is available.
