Following the first day's events at the [[2008 Taipei International Book Exhibition]] (TIBE), organisers used today as an opportunity for a number of [[w:autograph|autograph sessions]], the announcement of awards and a focus on the [[w:Taipei World Trade Center|Taipei World Trade Center]]'s Hall 3 where children's activities and seminars were being held.

The Kids' Book Hall, which was created with cooperation from the Regional Association of Educational Materials, saw a new addition this year in the form of the "Taiwan Stationery" pavilion. The display included a variety of paper products not only for children, but for small-business and general usage. 

In order to promote some conceptions on environment and recycling, Yuen Foong Yu Paper Mfg. Co. Ltd. sponsored the exhibition with recycled poster container and corrugated-fiberboard, which was used to design several nature scenes, and the material will be reusable in the future.

Participants also held several seminars at TWTC Hall 1 for reading population promotion, for example, a Taiwanese version of a famous magazine named ''"Kagakuru"''. Aimed at science education, imported by Taiwan Mac Education, and promoted by several academic professionals in Taiwan, the magazine will be released on March 3, 2008.
