The [[w:12th UN-Climate Conference|12th UN-Climate Conference]] was opened in Nairobi on Monday November 6, 2006. 

The aim of the negotiations is to find ways of assisting the developing countries to adapt to climate change. 

The formulation of goals for lowering [[w:greenhouse gas emissions|greenhouse gas emissions]] after the [[w:Kyoto-Protocol|Kyoto-Protocol]] runs out in [[w:2012|2012]] is high on the agenda. The [[w:World Meteorological Organisation|World Meteorological Organisation]] (WMO) reported half-a-percent rise in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere during 2005. This rise is destined to continue unless more positive action is taken. 

The [[w:United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) forecasts crop failures, flooding and threats to freshwater supplies. Actions to mitigate the effects of climate change in developing countries include developing new species of food crops, constructing sea defences, planting vegetation, improving the water-supply infrastructre in vulnerable areas and increasing public awareness of the need to conserve water.

Some 6,000 delegates will discuss these issues 6 - 17 November 2006.
 
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) senior-level round-table discussion on International Technology Cooperation on Environmentally Sound Technologies will take place on Tuesday, 14 November, 13.15 - 14.45

Of special interest will be the new report from UNFCCC on how climate change will affect the African continent.
