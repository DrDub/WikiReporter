Today, Chinese Wiki Conference 2006 ([http://cwc.cnic.org CWC2006]) organized by Cnic.org, a wikipedia-like wiki site, will be held in Shanghai. 

Those approximately 80 participants discussed in the municipal library Schanghais the future of the Wikis and tried to give to the movement in China new wind.

The Chinese Wiki Conference, the first such meet for Chinese Wikiers, aims to explore the further growth of Chinese wiki, and to provide a forum facilitating deeper exchanges among Chinese wikiers. (from [http://www.cnic.org/wiki/CWC2006 CWC2006 English page])
