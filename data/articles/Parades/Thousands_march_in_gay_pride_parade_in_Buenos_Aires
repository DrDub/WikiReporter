In statements made exclusively to ''Wikinews'', the chairwoman of the National Institute Against the Discrimination, Xenophobia and Racism (INADI) expressed that the march was of utmost importance.

"This is an advance for democracy, that we can gather so many people to celebrate diversity. We must work against all type of discrimination, and especially on this day against homophobia, and also pursue the rights not afforded us; for example, the identity of transsexual people," stated María José Lubertino, chairwoman of the INADI.

Lubertino stressed that INADI is trying to push for new legislation to be debated during 2008, and emphasized that during the course of this year, INADI has supported several couples' requests for [[w:same-sex marriage|same-sex marriage]]. Furthermore, INADI is also pushing for a debate in the National Congress to talk about civil union and marriage of [[w:LGBT|gay, lesbian, transvestite and transsexual]] people.

Several minority groups attended the parade and crossed the [[w:Avenida de Mayo|Avenida de Mayo]], entering the blocks that separates the Plaza de Mayo and the [[w:Argentine Chamber of Deputies|National Congress]]. [[w:Condom|Condoms]] and information about [[w:AIDS|AIDS]] were distributed during the parade.
