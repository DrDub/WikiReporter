In what may possibly be the largest [[w:Gay Pride|Gay Pride]] [[w:Pride parade|parade]] in the world, hundreds of thousands of people marched along the streets of [[w:São Paulo|São Paulo]], [[w:Brazil|Brazil]] today in the [[w:Parada do Orgulho GLBT de São Paulo|Parada do Orgulho GLBT de São Paulo]].  Many marchers were demanding the legalization of [[w:same-sex marriage|same-sex marriage]].

[[w:Religion in Brazil|Brazil is the largest Roman Catholic country on Earth]], and the [[w:Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] has consistently opposed the legalization of same-sex marriage in the country.  The [[w:National Congress of Brazil|National Congress of Brazil]] has debated legalization for 10 years, and such civil marriages are currently only legal in [[w:Rio Grande do Sul|Rio Grande do Sul]].  The original bill was drafted by former mayor of São Paulo, Marta Suplicy.  The proposed legislation, after being amended, is now in the hands of Roberto Jefferson.  Protesters hope to collect a petition of 1.2 million signatures to present to the National Congress in November.

People carrying flags and banners, some dressed in lavish carnival costumes, walked and danced in the ninth annual Gay Pride parade, stretching for 3.5 kilometres along [[w:Avenida Paulista|Avenida Paulista]].  Traffic was diverted throughout most of the city, and drinks and snacks vendors took advantage of the barriers across many streets.  Prominent people joining the parade were the actor Sergio Mamberti, representing the Culture Minister Gilberto Gil, and senator Eduardo Suplicy.
