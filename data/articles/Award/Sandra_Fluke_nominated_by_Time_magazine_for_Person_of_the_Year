Sandra Fluke was the focus of media in February after attempting to testify before a [[Republican party (United States)|Republican]]-controlled committee in the [[United States House of Representatives]] about {{w|contraception}} and {{w|women's health}}. Kate Pickert of ''Time'' wrote in her profile, "Fluke ... weathered the attention with poise and maturity and emerged as a political celebrity."

''Time'' concluded Fluke helped give U.S. President {{w|Barack Obama}} an edge in {{w|2012 United States presidential election|his presidential re-election campaign}}: "Democrats gave her a national-convention speaking slot as part of their push to make reproductive rights a central issue in the 2012 presidential campaign — one that helped Barack Obama trounce Mitt Romney among single women on Election Day."

{{QuoteLeft|Honored to be listed for Time's Person of Year.|4=[[Sandra Fluke]]}}
Fluke responded to the nomination via [[Twitter]], and stated she was "Honored to be listed for Time's Person of Year". In the same statement she also drew attention to the scarcity of [[women]] on the list of candidates.

An analysis of Fluke's candidacy by Peter Roff of ''{{w|U.S. News & World Report}}'' called attention to her role in the political phenomenon in the recent election cycle known as the "{{w|War on Women}}" which drew significant attention to issues of [[women's rights]]. Roff gave advice to the Republican party on the way it relates to women, "Once the Republicans become comfortable talking about all issues as though they were women's issues too — issues like unemployment, economic growth, job creation, education, and healthcare as well as the so-called social issues — they will be demonstrating that women have a home in the GOP. Until they do however it will be the Sandra Flukes of the world that continue to carry the day when it counts."

Journalist {{w|Leslie Marshall}} observed some conservative political commentators were critical of ''Time'' for its nomination of Fluke for Person of the Year. 

{{QuoteRight|... she showed true strength over adversity. And she has since become a women's health activist. For these reasons alone, she belongs on this list.|4={{w|Leslie Marshall}} }}

Marshall argued Fluke belongs on the list: "She should be credited with reminding women on both the right and the left; that many of us agree on the issue of women's reproductive rights. Although some of us might be Democrats and some Republicans, our gender unites us. She brought more women to the polls, reminding us of the decades it took to be where we are and what was at stake for women if we did not re-elect President Obama. In speaking at the Democratic National Convention, she showed true strength over adversity. And she has since become a women's health activist. For these reasons alone, she belongs on this list."

However, Marshall stated she wouldn't be voting for Fluke's candidacy, but would instead cast her ballot for {{w|Malala Yousafzai}}, a 15-year-old {{w|female education}} activist who survived a {{w|Taliban}} {{w|assassination}} attempt.

Fluke was a featured speaker on September 5 at the {{w|2012 Democratic National Convention}} in {{w|Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte}}, [[North Carolina]]. Fluke spoke to attendees at the convention about the consequences for [[women]] of electing Republican candidate for {{w|President of the United States|U.S. President}}, [[Mitt Romney]], over incumbent President {{w|Barack Obama}}. Fluke has campaigned with President Obama in his bid for re-election.

She was recognized April 22 with the ''Stand Up for Choice Award''. Fluke was given the ''Stand Up for Choice Award'' at the "Third Annual Multi-Generational Brunch" of the organization {{w|NARAL Pro-Choice America}} which was held in [[New York City]] (NYC), [[New York]] in the [[United States]]. 

Fluke received a nomination in March as a candidate for ''{{w|Time (magazine)|Time}}'' magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. The list is released annually as a special edition of ''Time'' magazine, titled ''{{w|Time 100}}''.

She gave testimony to the [[US Congress]] on February 23 before the {{w|House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee}} at a hearing about {{w|women's health}} and {{w|contraception}}. She also worked for Sanctuary for Families in NYC which worked to crack down on [[human trafficking]] and domestic violence.
