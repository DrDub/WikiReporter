WikiReporter
============

Everyday around the world public gatherings of different types go
undocumented in traditional media. Carefully documenting these
gatherings requires the rigorous notetaking and presentation skills
usually associated with journalists. To help citizen journalism,
WikiReporter is a tool that uses a dual template/fill-in-the-blank
approach to gather key semantic information about the event and then
make a draft WikiNews submission with the help of hand-built templates
derived from high quality journalistic text.
